## Description

***

This is a case for a new website and design for Islington Performance Parts (IPP), a fictitous motor vehicle parts shop in the north of Stockholm, Sweden. 
The main purpose of IPP is to provide high end alloy wheels to service the vehicle after-market modification community in Stockholm. 

Currently, the shop services a small community of enthusiasts in the North of Stockholm but is planning to enlarge their sales and after-service facilities to a much larger and wider market. This will be the first time the shop will be listed via a website with the view to attracting more customers from around Sweden and neighbouring Nordic countries.

The shop, located in the VÃ¤llingby area in the north of Stockholm, gets very few customers from beyond Kungsholmen (Central Stockholm). The purpose of the webpage and associated order forms, including a digital monthly catalogue, is to increase the customer-base to include a greater reach in the region. 

The website will be divided into four categories in a hope to encourage tech savvy motor enthusiasts:

1. Home: Introduction of IPP, opening hours and a small gallery of performance vehicles enhanced in the shop.
2. Shop: A showcase of the eight most popular alloy wheels with option to purchase and book a fitting.
3. Gallery: An exhibit of the latest styles and trends in the motor vehicle enthusiast's community. 
4. Sign-up: A membership application form with the view to receive a monthly catalogue as well as prospective specials. 
5. Pop-up Bookings: Located on every page in the footer and central on the front page, users can book a time to have their car fitted with new alloys. 

Users on Firefox may not experience the date and time picker on the form as expected. Though the inner workings are fine, the time and date picker icons do not display. 

Due to limited use of JavaScript there is no option to remove Sunday from the date picker despite the shop being closed on Sunday. 

The "buy now" form was partially templated from https://tutorialzine.com/2016/11/simple-credit-card-validation-form
